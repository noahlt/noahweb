I didn't read as many books as I would have liked in 2018. I spent less time reading in general, and that which I did spend reading was often sucked up in the news (bad habit). But some of the books I read were truly great, and I would like to recommend them here.

## How to Read a Book

This book is about reading, not just for information, but for understanding. How can we learn from a book, that is, when no teacher is present?

## The Odyssey (tr Emily Wilson)

I first read the Odyssey during the summer that I took my first job.

## The Book of Why

"Correlation is not causation," statisticians cheerfully admonish us. And empiricists love to dismiss any discussion of counterfactuals as nonsense. Yet we humans appear to do causal reasoning, often using counterfactuals, all the time. Judea Pearl published an academic book, Causality, discussing how we can do calculations on causal reasoning. The Book of Why is his nontechnical book for a lay audience.

## The Kierkegaard Reader (Hong & Hong)

Still working through this one.

- presentation of kierkegaard as a development of ideas is good
- seeing nihilism as a first stage of development is healthy

## North and South (Elizabeth Gaskell)

This is a better Victorian romance than Pride and Prejudice. But it also is a wonderful reflection on clashing cultures: rich and poor, new and old money, companies and unions, religious and atheist, rural and urban, pragmatic and aesthetic, and, of course, North and South (of England, that is). Anyone concerned about culture clashes, especially where one side is technological, will find it worthwhile. And it really is a great romance novel.

This book is available on Project Gutenberg, which I wish I'd realized before buying the Amazon Kindle version.

## Phaedrus (Plato)

If you read this for Socrates' critique of literacy (as I did), you should just skip to that section, which stands on its own and occurs near the end of the work. I was surprised to find that the part of his argument that is mentioned in popular culture, the idea that people will have no memory because they can just refer to writing, is (to me) the weakest part of his argument. Much stronger is the part where Socrates talks about the value of knowing the person you are speaking to, tailoring your argument to them, and engaging in them in dialogue, being able to ensure that they understand what you are saying. When I read about abstract topics, I am frequently afraid that I have misunderstood the author's arguments, so this part of the critique rang true for me.

The majority of the dialogue uses a discussion of Classical vs Romantic attitudes towards love as the example for a meta-discussion about rhetoric. Socrates keeps claiming to despise rhetoric while clearly being a master rhetorician, then ultimately saying that rhetoric is only good when used in the service of truth (ie, his sort of philosophy), which seems to preclude any sort of collaborative discussion. Honestly, I'm still not quite sure what to make of it.

I chose to read the Hackett edition, translated by Nehamas and Woodruff.

## Other books I read

I also read a bunch of other books, which were fine but not great, and I cannot be bothered to write reviews of them.

- It Can't Happen Here (Sinclair Lewis)
- How Change Happens
