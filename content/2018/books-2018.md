I didn't read as many books as I would have liked in 2018. I spent less time reading in general, and that which I did spend reading was often sucked up in the news (bad habit). But some of the books I read were truly great, and I would like to recommend them here.

## How to Read a Book (Adler & van Doren)

This book is about reading, not just for information, but for understanding. How can we learn from a book, that is, how can we learn when no teacher is present?

A friend of mine used to amuse himself by holding this book upside-down while riding the subway.

## The Odyssey (tr Emily Wilson)

I first read the Odyssey during the summer that I moved to San Francisco for my first job.  At the time, I was somewhat adrift. I had been disappointed with school, and the feeling was mutual. An ingrained sense of meritocracy made me doubt myself: if I wasn't winning, then didn't that make me, well, a _loser_?

The Odyssey showed me a man who hasn‘t been winning, but is far from a loser. Odysseus is wandering, at times he is literally adrift in the wine-dark sea, but he has integrity the whole way through. Reading the Odyssey as a young man was a vital part of building a resilient self-image.

That time, of course, I was reading the Fagles translation. This year I read the excellent new translation by Emily Wilson. It’s written in metered verse, and it’s beautiful. Just read the opening:

> Tell me about a complicated man.<br>
> Muse, tell me how he wandered and was lost<br>
> when he had wrecked the holy town of Troy,<br>
> and where he went, and who he met, the pain<br>
> he suffered in the storms at sea, and how<br>
> he worked to save his life and bring his men<br>
> back home. He failed to keep them safe; poor fools,<br>
> they ate the Sun God’s cattle, and the god<br>
> kept them from home. Now goddess, child of Zeus,<br>
> tell the old story for our modern times.<br>
> Find the beginning.

You will have noticed that the style is modern rather than archaic. Wilson's excellent justification is that Homer’s culture was totally unrelated to Milton and Shakespeare; there's no reason to make Homer sound like them.

Wilson acknowledges the different and, really, alien virtues of Homeric culture. Every translation glorifies Odysseus’ _metis_ (loosely, “cunning”), but Wilson also emphasizes the Homeric take on friendship, the Greek virtue of hospitality, and (through Telemachus) a healthy attitude towards coming-of-age.

Wilson also, unlike some other translations, doesn't try to impose our culture’s values on the Odyssey, and doesn’t gloss over anything we might find unacceptable. She never translates “slave” as “servant”. But she also doesn't insert misogynistic language, as Fagles does when he has Telemachus call the slave girls “sluts”. Nor does she add new value judgments; Polyphemus the Cyclops is not a “monster” (as Fagles would have him), but a “person”. Much of this is treated in the translation's introduction. Wilson also discusses translation on her fantastic Twitter account, [@EmilyRCWilson](https://twitter.com/EmilyRCWilson), and many of her threads on translation [have been collected here](https://www.emilyrcwilson.com/emilyrcwilson-scholia).

Finally, a note for parents: in a podcast interview, Wilson was asked whether the Odyssey is appropriate for children.  Wilson responded that many of the poem’s themes are questions that children understand, because they are real problems for children as well as adults: Who is family?  Who is allowed to enter our home, and what are they allowed to do there?  How do I treat strangers?  What should I do when I’m lost?

The Odyssey is a profound book that deeply influenced me; this new translation is readable, thought-provoking, and fresh.  You should read it.

## North and South (Elizabeth Gaskell)

This is a better Victorian romance than Pride and Prejudice. But it also is a wonderful reflection on clashing cultures: rich and poor, new and old money, companies and unions, religious and atheist, rural and urban, pragmatic and aesthetic, and, of course, North and South (of England, that is). Anyone concerned about culture clashes, especially where one side is technological, will find it worthwhile. And it really is a great romance novel.

This book is available on Project Gutenberg, which I wish I'd noticed before buying the Amazon Kindle version.

## Phaedrus (Plato)

If you read this for Socrates' critique of literacy (as I did), you should just skip to that section, which stands on its own and occurs near the end of the work. I was surprised to find that the part of his argument that is mentioned in popular culture, the idea that people will have no memory because they can just refer to writing, is (to me) the weakest part of his argument. Much stronger is the part where Socrates talks about the value of knowing the person you are speaking to, tailoring your argument to them, and engaging in them in dialogue, being able to ensure that they understand what you are saying. When I read about abstract topics, I am frequently afraid that I have misunderstood the author's arguments, so this part of the critique rang true for me.

The majority of the dialogue uses a discussion of Classical vs Romantic attitudes towards love as the example for a meta-discussion about rhetoric. Socrates keeps claiming to despise rhetoric while clearly being a master rhetorician, then ultimately saying that rhetoric is only good when used in the service of truth (ie, his sort of philosophy), which seems to preclude any sort of collaborative discussion. Honestly, I'm still not quite sure what to make of it.

I chose to read the Hackett edition, translated by Nehamas and Woodruff.

## Other books I read

I also read a bunch of other books, which were fine but not great, and I cannot be bothered to write reviews for all of them.

- _My Brilliant Friend_ (Ferrante). Lovely depiction of growing up as a precocious kid in a rough neighborhood.
- _The Talented Mr Ripley_ (Highsmith)
- _A Tale for the Time Being_ (Ozeki). As fiction about the act of reading, better than _If On a Winter’s Night a Traveller_.
- _It Can't Happen Here_ (Lewis). timely, but nothing particularly insightful.
- _Vile Bodies_ (Waugh)
- _Anathem_ and _Seveneves_ (Stephenson). There just isn't any science fiction like Neal Stephenson.
- _Red Mars_ (Robinson). Extremely disappointing. Feels like it was written by an engineer who woke up one day and said, “What if greatest challenges of interplanetary colonization aren’t _technical_, but _political_!!” and then wrote a book congratulating himself for the insight.
- _The Tenant of Wildfell Hall_ (Anne Brontë). A much more candid depiction of the romance of the time than the other Brontë sisters’.
- _The Magic Toyshop_ (Carter). Seemed a bit sensational to me.
- _How Change Happens — Or Doesn't_ (Kamark). This book didn't explain things as much as I had hoped for when I picked it, which was disappointing. But in the months since reading it I've found myself referring to its metaphor of politics as battleground, and a few of its models, from time to time, so I'm glad I read it.

## Books I'm still working through

_The Book of Why_ (Judea Pearl). “Correlation is not causation,” statisticians cheerfully admonish us. And empiricists love to dismiss any discussion of counterfactuals as nonsense. Yet we humans appear to do causal reasoning, often using counterfactuals, all the time. Judea Pearl published an academic book, Causality, discussing how we can do calculations on causal reasoning. The Book of Why is his nontechnical book for a lay audience. It is excellent so far.

_The Kierkegaard Reader_ (Kierkegaard, ed. Hong & Hong). My first attempts at Kierkegaard were fitful; it wasn't until I read the [SEP entry on Kierkegaard]() that I had the proper context to read him. In particular, Kierkegaard‘s writing progresses through stages of thought, and we must go through that journey with him — he doesn't just lay out his conclusions in an easily digestible essay. I can only take him in small doses, but when I'm in the right mood he is just what I need.

_Zhuangzi_. Unlike the poetry of the _Tao Te Ching_, or the essays and aphorisms of Confucius, Zhuangzi is structured more like the Gospels, in that it's presented as a collection of stories and dialogues. His approach (Daoism) is not wholly palatable to me, but parts of it really highlight flaws or omissions in my own attitude.
